Power management tools
----------------------
This is a small collection of power management test and
investigation tools.  See http://lesswatts.org/projects/acpi/
for more information on ACPI for Linux.

./turbostat/turbostat
--------------------
man turbostat/turbostat.8

./acpidump/acpidump
-------------------
This utility dumps a system's ACPI tables to an ASCII file.

Typically it is used to dump all the ACPI tables
to attach to a bug report for later examination:

    # ./acpidump > acpidump.out

./acpidump/acpixtract-pmtools
-----------------------------
Convert ASCII acpidump output to raw binary tables:

	$ acpixtract/acpixtract-pmtools -a acpidump.out
	Acpi table [DSDT] -  15974 bytes written to DSDT.dat
	Acpi table [FACS] -     64 bytes written to FACS.dat
	Acpi table [FACP] -    116 bytes written to FACP.dat
	Acpi table [APIC] -    120 bytes written to APIC.dat
	Acpi table [WDDT] -     64 bytes written to WDDT.dat
	Acpi table [MCFG] -     60 bytes written to MCFG.dat
	Acpi table [ASF!] -    166 bytes written to ASF!.dat
	Acpi table [SSDT] -    444 bytes written to SSDT1.dat
	Acpi table [SSDT] -    439 bytes written to SSDT2.dat
	Acpi table [SSDT] -    439 bytes written to SSDT3.dat
	Acpi table [SSDT] -    439 bytes written to SSDT4.dat
	Acpi table [SSDT] -    439 bytes written to SSDT5.dat
	Acpi table [RSDT] -     76 bytes written to RSDT.dat
	Acpi table [RSDP] -     20 bytes written to RSDP.dat


Disassembler
------------
Convert binary table into human readable form
iasl can be downloaded from Intel:
http://www.intel.com/technology/IAPC/acpi/downloads.htm

Which creates DSDT.dsl this way:

	$ iasl -a *.dat
	...
	creates *.dsl

pmtest -- does not work
------
This utility can be used by Linux kernel developers to test
power management support in their drivers.  It consists of
an installable kernel module and a Perl script to drive
the module.

Example: pmtest -d3 VGA
